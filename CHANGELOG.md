# Changelog

## 7.0.1

- Migrate to type module [#141](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/141) by [@jdeniau](https://github.com/jdeniau)
  (It should have been released in the 7.0.0 as it might be breaking, but I do not want to push a new major two just some days after the last one as this package is not widely used)

## 7.0.0

### Changed

- [Breaking] If unitOfWork is disabled in the global configuration, then it will be disabled for all call to getRepository. [#111](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/111). Waiting to resolve issue with `create` and `update` to bump `7.0.0` version.

- Start implementing a logger. You need to enable it with `config.loggerEnabled` if you want to log request:

A possible interesting configuration is to activate the logger on dev environment.

```js
const sdk = new TicketingSdk(tokenStorage, {
  path: process.env.API_DOMAIN,
  scheme: 'https',
  loggerEnabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
});
```

- Add Logger in RestClientSdkInterface
- Add a helper to get JSON of an HttpError [#122](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/122)
- Fixed makeUri method to handle more than one URI segment [#128](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/128)
- Call toString on URLSearchParams body to ensure ReactNative compatibility [#130](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/130)
- Remove referer as it is handled by the browser [#135](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/135) by [@jdeniau](https://github.com/jdeniau)
- Fix issue in handling 401 error with anything else than "invalid_grant" [#137](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/137) by [@jdeniau](https://github.com/jdeniau)
- allow calling create, update, delete with a disabled unitOfWork [#140](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/140) by [@jdeniau](https://github.com/jdeniau)

## 7.0.0-rc.2

- Start implementing a logger. You need to enable it with `config.loggerEnabled` if you want to log request:

A possible interesting configuration is to activate the logger on dev environment.

```js
const sdk = new TicketingSdk(tokenStorage, {
  path: process.env.API_DOMAIN,
  scheme: 'https',
  loggerEnabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
});
```

## 7.0.0-rc.1

### Update

- [Breaking] If unitOfWork is disabled in the global configuration, then it will be disabled for all call to getRepository. [#111](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/111). Waiting to resolve issue with `create` and `update` to bump `7.0.0` version.

## 6.6.2

Fix issue with response body already consumed when an error occured while generating token

## 6.6.1

Do not use async / await to avoid regeneratorRuntime issue

## 6.6.0

- Add Authorization code flow token generator
- Better compatibility with the oauth spec: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749
- handle oauth error even if the TokenGenerator does not extends `AbstractTokenGenator` or call `_manageOauthError`
- [Minor BC] `TokenGenerator.generateToken` and `TokenGenerator.generateToken` might return a `Response` instead of a plain object. This should not break anything as the response is handled by the `TokenStorage` unless you call directly the `TokenGenerator` (which you should not). Returning an object has been deprecated and is only used in the `ProvidedTokenGenerator` (which is also deprecated)
- [Minor BC] `OauthError.previousError` might be undefined
- [Deprecation] Deprecate `ProvidedTokenGenerator`. You should use one of the oauth2 generator or implement your own custom generator.
- [Deprecation] Calling `AbstractTokenGenerator._manageOauthError` is deprecated. You should return the `Response` instead :

```diff
   generateToken() {
     const body = // â€¦ generate body

     return fetch(url, {
       method: 'POST',
       body,
+    });
-    }).then((response) => {
-      if (response.status < 400) {
-        return response;
-      }

-      return this._manageOauthError(response);
-    });
   }
```

## 6.5.2

Fix regression from `6.5.1` : `TokenStorage.refreshToken` does now throws an Error anymore if there is no token stored in the storage.

## 6.5.1

- getItem from AsyncStorage interface might return null
- `TokenStorage.refreshToken` now throws an Error if there is no token stored in the storage.

## 6.5.0

### Added

Accept Relation.ONE_TO_ONE relation.
It is basically handled the same way as MANY_TO_ONE, but has been added for semantic purpose.
The comportment may differ later.

## 6.4.1

### Fixed

- withUnitOfWork returns a clone of the base repository to avoid race condition on `isUnitOfWorkEnabled`

## 6.4.0

- allow unitOfWork deactivation on find\* calls

## 6.3.0

### Added

Accept Relation.MANY_TO_MANY relation.
It is basically handled the same way as ONE_TO_MANY, but has been added for semantic purpose.
The comportment may differ later.

## 6.2.0

### Changed

- [TypeScript] better handle deserializeResponse method definition

## 6.1.0

### Added

Export `MetadataDefinition` for AbstractClient inheritance

## 6.0.0

### Changed

- [BREAKING] UnitOfWork is disabled by default, one must add a prop `unitOfWorkEnabled` with value true to the config object passed to the RestClientSdk's constructor in order to enable it
- TokenStorage's `generateToken` and `refreshToken` methods are now memoized in order to avoid bugs when making concurrent calls

## 5.0.0

This release is a migration to TypeScript, but the API stay the same. The only breaking changes are more fixed bugs that might be breaking in really improbable case.

### Changed

- [BREAKING] TokenGenerator's `refreshToken` method signature changed from `refreshToken(accessToken, parameters)` to `refreshToken(accessToken)`.
  If you did extend the `AbstractToken` generator, you shouldn't relly on the second parameter.
  As a matter of fact, the auto-refreshed token in `AbstractClient` did not send any parameters either, so it should not have been working before !
  Accordingly The `refreshToken` method of `TokenStorage` signature changed from `refreshToken(parameters)` to `refreshToken()`
- [Might Break] all pseudo-private methods and attributes (starting with `_`) are unavailable and are now really private (or protected).
  - `_storeAccessToken` should be replace by a `ProvidedTokenGenerator`
- [Might Break] `ClassMetadata`, `Attribute` and `Relation` attributes are now `readonly`. You can not change them after initialization.
- [Might Break] `AbstractTokenGenerator` is now abstract. It should not have been used directly anyway. It implies that the method that previously did thrown errors are not callable (`generateToken`, `refreshToken` and `checkTokenGeneratorConfig`). They should not have been called. They don't exist in JS land anymore.
- [Might Break] `canAutogenerateToken` has been removed from the token storages and replaced by a `autogenerateToken()` method (it's not real POO, but I did not manage to deal with instance of for now)
- [Might Break] AbstractClient.\_refreshTokenAndRefetch does not take the response as a first argument (it wan unused). The method was supposed to be private be the way.

- Make `SerializerInterace` and `Serializer` input and output understandable

### Added

- export (and implement) `RestClientSdkInterface` and `TokenStorageInterface`
- export `TokenGeneratorInterface` and `AsyncStorageInterface`

## 4.1.4

### Changed

- Passing a string as argument to `ProvidedTokenGenerator` is now deprecated. You should pass the token object instead. It should have had a weird comportment before by the way.

### Fixed

- Fix issue when two token generation are send on the same time : the second one will not throw an error now.

## 4.1.3

### Fixed

- Fix issue when no token is provided but the object is `{ expires_at: null }`

## 4.1.2

### Fixed

- Fix issue with urijs 1.19.2

## 4.1.1

### Changed

- replace object spread with Object.assign for build to work

## 4.1.0

### Changed

- main AbstractClient CRUD methods accept additional requestParams for overriding fetch params like method, headers, etc.

## 4.0.1

### Changed

- downgraded jest and babel-jest to ^23.6.0 in order to fix tests

## 4.0.0

### Changed

- Do not generate token expires_at in \_storeAccessToken since it is sometimes used from outside, in tests for instance (even though it is supposed to be private)
- [Breaking] throw new error types when oauth calls fail, they all wrap the originalError => InvalidGrantError, InvalidScopeError which both extend OauthError. Original error can be found at error.previousError. If it was an HttpError the response is at error.previousError.baseResponse

## 3.2.1

### Changed

- Refactor error handling with error factory and handle 400's in refreshToken of PasswordGenerator

## 3.2.0

### Changed

- Pre-emptively refresh the access token if it is close to expiration before doing any request

## 3.1.1

### Changed

- Read json response in \_manageUnauthorized when www-authenticate header is not available

## 3.1.0

### Changed

- Store a new key `expires_at` in the access token (which is accessible with `TokenStorage.getAccessTokenObject`) to have the timestamp after which the access token will be invalid, based on the `expires_in`
- Add `TokenStorage.getCurrentTokenExpiresIn` function to known how many seconds are remaining for the access token currently stored

## 3.0.0

### Changed

- [Breaking] `AccessDeniedError` is now `UnauthorizedError`
- [Breaking] Default error is now `HttpError`
- Add `ConflictError` to react to 409

## 2.3.0

### Changed

- `TokenStorage` add possibility to pass access_token async storage key as constructor param
- `AbstractClient._manageAccessDenied` checks headers instead of json to ensure refreshing the token is required

## 2.2.1

### Changed

- `TokenStorage.getAccessTokenObject()` returns an object and null if the stored token is not an object
- [Might Break] `TokenStorage.getAccessTokenObject()` does not return `undefined` anymore but `null` if no token object is found

## 2.2.0

### Changed

- Add possibility to pass null as tokenStorage argument of the sdk
- switch method names \_doFetch and \_fetchWithToken in AbstractClient for coherence

## 2.1.0

### Changed

- Add method getAccessTokenObject to TokenStorage

## 2.0.1

### Changed

- Better packaging system [#48](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/48)

## 2.0.0

### Added

- [Might break] Custom serializer can:
  - `serializeItem` has been splitted into `normalizeItem` + `encodeItem`
  - `deserializeItem` has been splitted into `denormalizeItem` + `decodeItem`
  - `deserializeList` has been splitted into `denormalizeList` + `decodeList`

You must implement them if you have a custom serialization that do not use plain javascript objects.

### Changed

- [Breaking] Calling `restClientSdk.foo.xxx` is deprecated, you must now call `restClientSdk.getRepository('foo').xxx`
- [Breaking] RestClientSdk now takes a Mapping instance instead of a clientList. This instance is required
- [Breaking] `getName` has been removed and replaced by the classmetadata key. Its return was previously sent to the serializer, it's now the mapping that is sent now.
  Beware that now, the `key` is now used both to call the repository name, and passed to the serializer
  Before:

```js
class SomeClient extends AbstractClient {
  getName() {
    return 'SomeClient';
  }
}

new RestClientSdk(
  // ...
  {
    foo: SomeClient,
  }
);
```

Now:

```js
  const metadata = new ClassMetadata('foo', 'some_endpoint');
  mapping = new Mapping();
  mapping.setMapping([ metadata ]);

  const sdk = new RestClientSdk(/* ... */, mapping); // `foo` will be used in serializer too
  sdk.foo.find();
```

- [Breaking] Custom Serializer: If you had a Collection entity containing the result of you entities, you will need to implement the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol) on this object, this way, we can register all entities in the unit of work.

### Removed

- Dropped support for node 6
- AbstractClient does not need to specify `getPathBase` anymore: this is generated via the classmetata. You can still override it.
- `getEntityURI` is not mandatory anymore. it will be autogenerate by the AbstractClient. You can still override it
- There is no need to create an empty client extending `AbstractClient` now, the default will be `AbstractClient`
- config `prefix` is not used anymore, you should specify your prefix in the mapping: `new Mapping('/v1')`

### Added

- Added the current URI as referer for http calls

## [0.14.x]

### breaking changes

Error responses in PasswordGenerator and ClientCredentialsGenerator now throw
proper js errors instead of returning the response in the promise rejection

## [0.13.x]

### breaking changes

The library does not depends on `immutablejs` anymore, so we needed to make a
few breaking changes:

- Do not depend on `@id` anymore: The `AbstractClient` need to implements a
  `getEntityURI(entity)` and return an query string from it. This is not a great
  pattern, but it will do for now.
  (https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/19)
- The `entityFactory` does not exists anymore. It has been replaced by a
  `Serializer`: (https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/21)
  - If you used the default entityFactory, you will now receive plain Javascript
    objects instead of immutable's Map or List
  - If you previously overrided the `entityFactory`, you will need to switch to
    the new `Serializer` object: It is much more extensible but is a bit more
    complex to extend. See README to know how to do it.
  - the `createEntityFromJsonResponse` method has been renamed to
    `deserializeResponse`
- The library moved from ES5 to bundling with rollupjs, that should not break
  anything and should improve size of bundle but I am not so sure of this, so
  patch may follow (https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/20)

## [0.12.x]

### breaking changes

- a `delete` does not call `createEntityFromJsonResponse` anymore as it should
  return a "204 No Content" or a "404 Not Found"

## [0.11.x]

### breaking changes

- `ProviderTokenGenerator` does not accept a param object anymore on its second
  argument.

### new features

- `ProviderTokenGenerator` now accept a function on its second argument which
  will be called on `refreshToken`, so you can fully customize the behavior. The
  function must return a Promise.

## [0.9.x]

### breaking changes

- if the response status is 4xx or 5xx: an error is thrown
  [#13](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/13)

### new features

- memoize token generation and refresh
  [#12](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-js-sdk/pull/12)

## [0.6.x]

### breaking changes

The `queryParam` argument was added where needed in the AbstractClient class:

- `findAll(queryParam = {}, pathParameters = {})`
- `create(entity, queryParam = {}, pathParameters = {})`

### new features

The `queryParam` argument was added where needed in the AbstractClient class:

- `update(entity, queryParam = {})`
